  <h2>Three Pieces for Coreto</h2>
  <p>In 2017 I finished composing a group of three pieces for the 12-piece ensemble Coreto. This was part of the portfolio that I submited for my master's degree in Composition, and the musicians of Coreto were nice enough to play at the finishing recital. At the time I was very much interested in exploring algorithmic manipulations of musical structures, but I don't think that it shows in the music (fortunately, I guess...). In 2022 the Coreto kindly decided to approach the pieces once again, and produced the following video.</p>
  <p>It's a recording of the studio session, prefaced by an interview, interspaced with bits from a previous concert.</p>
