  <p>This recording stems from the participation of Nuno Trocado (guitar, electronics) and Sérgio Tavares (bass, electronics) in <a href="https://expurgar.myportfolio.com/work">the interdisciplinary project Expurgar</a>, led by artist Dária Salgado, which she described as "an intimate geography, scored in and lived through a body poetically articulated with a lived-space, in a notional play against the fear of death". With the themes, contexts, memories and pre-existing materials of the project as a starting point, Nuno and Sérgio went into the studio to improvise, expand, and develop them further. The result is this series of "sonic derivations".</p>
