<h2>Arranjo Floral / Floral Arrangement</h2>
<section>
  <p>A botanical residue of immanent structure, placed among us in a reciprocal projection. A technical representation, under the form of a prototype, flowing, through an inorganic torrent of electrons, from the industrial laboratory where nature is the measure of all things, and where the physicochemical composts of ingenuity, either fragile or robust, are planted in dark earth. Sonosynthesis is heard through touching, thought through our bodies.</p>
  <p><em>Floral Arrangement</em> is an interactive sonic sculpture, commissioned by the Porta-Jazz association and presented in a collective exhibition inaugurated in Porto, Portugal, in February 2023.</p.>
