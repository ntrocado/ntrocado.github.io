<p>
Here's what's going on:
</p>

<p>
Append <i>four complementary trichords</i><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, such that all twelve (4x3=12) notes together constitute an aggregate (the twelve notes of the chromatic scale).
</p>

<p>
The resulting <i>row</i> is not used exactly in dodecaphonic fashion, because we don't have to progress ineluctably from tone to tone; rather, we define four different places (the four trichords), and we can linger on any of them for as long as we like, or go back and forth between them, or use some as consonances and the others as dissonances. The integrity of the trichord, however, should be preserved&#x2014;in principle all three notes are sounded, simultaneously or in succession, before we progress to the next trichord. This is similar to the technique of <i>triad pairs</i>, but dealing with other three-note groupings beyond the major and minor triads, and with four groupings in total instead of only two.
</p>

<p>
This idea is thoroughly explored in John O'Gallagher's book <a href="https://johnogallagher.com/book"><i>Twelve-Tone Improvisation&#x2014;A Method for Using Tone Rows in Jazz</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
Of the existing trichord classes, one that I've been focusing on is (014). We get a nice intervallic combination of thirds and sixths together with minor seconds (or ninths, etc.) and major sevenths. It also captures the augmented second sound associated, e.g., with the harmonic minor scale, while being a building block for other frequent musical structures. In a <a href="http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.09.15.5/mto.09.15.5.kuusi.php">2009 study</a>, participants classified it as "non-familiar dissonant," associated with words like "repulsive," "hard," "cold," "cruel," "excited," "unstable," "dangerous," "oppressive," "unfamiliar" and "odd." Given that, what's not to like?

This text may be a little heavy on <i>pitch class set theory</i> nomenclature, which I find it useful for labeling and articulating some musical concepts. If this is unfamiliar, a good textbook is <i>Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory</i> by Joseph N. Strauss, and of course there are many instructive materials on-line. I've been noticing, however, that some people are put off, and even hostile, both toward the theory and to the music commonly associated with it. If this is the case with you, well, what can I say&#x2026;
