<p>My master's thesis.</p>
<p>With the issues of human-machine interaction in the compositional process as a background, the present dissertation follows three simultaneous vectors: (a) a portfolio of some of the music that I wrote in the past two years, in which I applied (b) a set of computer-assisted algorithmic composition tools that I developed synchronously in that period of time, following (c) a reflection on the underlying concepts, presented here monographically. A library in Common Lisp stands out among the tools, including functions to perform simple combinatorics with large pitch collections and to the exploration of geometric properties observed in rhythmic and tonal cycles, as well as a program to manipulate audio using Markov chains. The written music—which is an integral part of this work—is simultaneously the point of departure and the point of arrival for the research path that I followed.</p>
